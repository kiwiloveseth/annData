- **Page layouts**: Consistent spacing and structure

## Data Flow

### Static Data Structure
```
data/
├── crops.json          # Farmer's crop inventory
├── marketplace.json    # Available crops for purchase
├── traceability.json   # Supply chain journey data
└── profile.json        # Farmer profile and transactions
```

### Data Relationships
- Crops reference farmers and locations
- Traceability links to specific crop IDs
- Profile aggregates transaction history
- Marketplace displays available inventory

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Multi-criteria search with sorting
3. **Interactive Maps**: Geographic crop location display
4. **Chat System**: Direct farmer-buyer communication
5. **Mobile App**: React Native implementation

### Technical Improvements
1. **State Management**: Redux or Zustand for complex state
2. **API Integration**: REST API consumption with caching
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Web3 wallet connectivity
4. **Progressive Web App**: Offline capability and push notifications
